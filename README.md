# Advanced Programming Exam BST and Reverse Dictionary (A.Y 2020-2021)
## Binary search tree 

Implementation of a **template** binary search tree (BST). 
In the file exam_cpp.pdf there are the assignments for the project while
in the [source] (https://github.com/Luca-Crozzoli/Advanced-Programming-2020-2021-BST/tree/main/source) folder there is the code.

## How to compile and run the code
- `make` to compile the code
- `make clean` to delete the executable obtained after the compilation
- `make run` to run the code after the compilation
- `make valgrind` to run the code after the compilation with valgrind to check if there are memory leaks.

## Short report
### What I understood
- How to write and use a simple Makefile
- Clarified the concepts introduced during lectures
- Learned something more about the algorithms behind the BST

## Reverse Dictionary

Implementation of a revers dictionary. The description of the assignment
and the solution is written in the file [python_exam.ipynb](https://github.com/Luca-Crozzoli/Advanced-Programming-2020-2021-BST/blob/main/python_exam.ipynb)
