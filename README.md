# Advanced Programming Exam BST (A.Y 2020-2021)
## Binary search tree

Implementation of a **template** binary search tree (BST). 

## How to compile and run the code
- `make` to compile the code
- `make clean` to delete the executable obtained after the compilation
- `make run` to run the code after the compilation
- `make valgrind` to run the code after the compilation with valgrind to check if there are memory leaks.

## Short report
### What I understood
- How to write and use a simple Makefile
- Clarified the concepts introduced during lectures
- Learned something more about the algorithms behind the BST
